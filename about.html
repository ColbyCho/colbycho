            <p>Product designer based in Boston</p>
            <span id="about-me-p">
                I recently graduated from Tufts University where I studied Engineering Psychology and Computer Science. My education lies at the intersection of design, science, and art, providing me with a multi-faceted understanding of the design process. This interdisciplinary education coupled with my experiences at small startups, a mid-size company, and an international corporation have molded me into an adaptable and creative UX/UI designer that can take a product from zero to one. <br>     
                <br>
                Over the last few years, I have developed an affinity for interaction design and UI development. I love solving problems and telling stories through sound visual design, and I view my process as equally creative as it is scientific. I conduct research, ideate, design, test, and rapidly iterate to craft engaging digital experiences that harmonize aesthetics and usability. My process is also evolving. As I develop as a designer, I find myself continuously learning, especially as the digital landscape is ever-changing. I believe these learnings are reflected in my work, some of which is housed on this handcrafted site. Feel free to look around! <br>
                <br>
                I am now looking for my next challenge. If you are looking for a detail-oriented and creative designer, let's connect! <br><br>
